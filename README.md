# 3dModel-Mixer

A program to mix up the data in a 3d model in order to make it unrecognizable, but if you run it through the program again with the same parameters, it will revert it to the original model

The idea is based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMLdy_USwXU) and this [program](https://www.plummerfernandez.com/works/disarming-corruptor).
